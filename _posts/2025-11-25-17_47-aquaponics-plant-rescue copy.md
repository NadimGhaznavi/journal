title:  "11/25 - 17:47 : Aquaponics - Plant Rescue"
---

I have a mini-aquaponics setup with a couple of gravel beds hosting lettuce, miniature roses, brocolli and more. The primary tank houses a community of guppies and some aquarium plants. I recently had a tall plant break loose; it's a bit turbulent in those waters with the *bell siphon* *drain-and-flood* bed.

I broke the long stem apart and replanted it into garden soil with some rocks and gravel to hold the soil in place.
