title:  "12/01 - 13:00 : Routine blood work"
---

It's Monday!! Went to my **Family Doctor** for routine blood work. It's **great** to have a family doctor again instead of relying on walk-in clinics and the emergency department at the hospital. OH, and -of course- being a Canadian so it's FREE!!! Whenever I do anything medical, I'm always reminded of my American friends who don't have access to affordable, let alone free, healthcare. I'm pretty sure the US is the only first world country on the planet that doesn't have free healthcare of some sort. That's just wrong.

I cycled to the doctor's, had my appointment, stopped and picked up a few groceries and cyclled home. Total time outside the home was less than an hour!! SUPER convenient! :)

The nurse who took my blood was great too: Gentle and professional.
