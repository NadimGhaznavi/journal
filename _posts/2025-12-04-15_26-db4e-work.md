title:  "12/04 - 15:26 : Db4E - Ongoing Work"
---

Continued to work on [Db4E](https://db4e.osoyalce.com/), the *Database 4 Everything*. This is the unified Monero XMR mining dashboard for deployment, operation and real-time analytics that I'm working on.

I'm currently focusing on creating a comprehensive test suite. **Db4E** has hit a high enough degree of complexity such that ad-hoc, clicking through the TUI is not sufficient to validate the correctness of the code. A test suite has become essential to support the ongoing development. Of course, a comprehensive test suite has more obvious benefits.

# Completed 100% test coverage of `OpsDb`

## Pytest Run

Here's a snippet from `poetry run pytest -v`:
