title:  "11/26 - 20:44 : Gallery Site Custom Theme"
---

After spending the better part of two days fighting with [minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), I ripped everything out and started fresh. I've created a stripped down GitHub Pages Jekyll theme to apply to the [Gallery](https://gallery.osoyalce.com/). I'd like to do further customizations, but it's fully functional and ready for the Big Time now!
