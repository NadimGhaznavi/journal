# Custom Colors

The **Colors** section near the top of the file sets the colors for the theme.

- [Neon Skin file](_sass/minimal-mistakes/skins/_neon.scss) - `_sass/minimal-mistakes/skins/_neon.scss`.


## Navigation Button Colors


The line below (from the *Neon Skin file* file) shows where to change the color of the *Previous* and *Next* button colors.

```
    background-color: #2c3a10;
```

Here's the old line:

```
    background-color: $primary-color; 
```
