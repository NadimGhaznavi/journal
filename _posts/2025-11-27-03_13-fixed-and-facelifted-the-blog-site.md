title:  "11/27 - 03:13 : Fixed and Facelifted the Blog Site"
---

I noticed a couple of broken links on my [Blog](https://blog.osoyalce.com) site. Instead 
of just fixing them on the static homepage, I replaced the theme with the same 
[minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme that I just used
on the [Journal](https://journal.osoyalce.com) site.

I'm liking it more and more these days.

It's a relatively lightweight, clean Jeykyll Theme, perfect for the
[Blog](https://blog.osoyalce.com) site.

If you're looking for a theme that's easy to setup and customize, I recommend it.

And here's the Bear & Moose logo, 'cause I just like it and it's a pretty new creation.
